ðŸ§ª Question 1: Convolution Operations with Different Parameters

Step 1: Define the Input Matrix  
A 5x5 input matrix is reshaped to (1, 5, 5, 1) to match the Conv2D input format.

Step 2: Define the Kernel  
A 3x3 Laplacian-style kernel is used for edge detection and reshaped to (3, 3, 1, 1).

Step 3: Apply Convolution  
A function is created to perform convolution with different stride and padding values. The Conv2D layer is initialized and the weights (kernel) are manually set.

Step 4: Results  
Convolution is tested with:
- Stride = 1, Padding = 'valid'  
- Stride = 1, Padding = 'same'  
- Stride = 2, Padding = 'valid'  
- Stride = 2, Padding = 'same'  

Each output is printed to observe changes in output size and pattern.

Question 2: CNN Feature Extraction with Filters and Pooling

Task 1: Edge Detection using Sobel Filter

Step 1: Load Grayscale Image  
The image is loaded using OpenCV in grayscale mode.

Step 2: Apply Sobel Filter  
Sobel filters are applied in X and Y directions to detect vertical and horizontal edges.

Step 3: Display Results  
The original, Sobel-X, and Sobel-Y images are displayed using matplotlib.

# Task 2: Max Pooling and Average Pooling

Step 1: Create Random Input  
A random 4x4 matrix is created and reshaped to (1, 4, 4, 1) for CNN input.

Step 2: Apply Pooling  
- Max Pooling: captures strong features  
- Average Pooling: averages values and smooths

Step 3: Display Output  
Prints the original, max pooled, and average pooled matrices for comparison.

Question 3: Data Preprocessing â€“ Standardization vs. Normalization

Step 1: Load Dataset  
The Iris dataset is loaded using load_iris() from sklearn.datasets.

Step 2: Apply Scaling  
- Min-Max Normalization: scales features to [0, 1]  
- Z-score Standardization: scales features to mean = 0, std = 1

Step 3: Model Training  
A Logistic Regression model is trained and tested on:
- Original data  
- Min-Max Normalized data  
- Z-score Standardized data  

Step 4: Distribution Visualization  
Histograms are plotted for each feature in original, normalized, and standardized forms.

# task 5
Explanation â€“ Normalization vs. Standardization

Use Normalization when features need to be in a fixed range (e.g., [0,1]), common in neural networks using sigmoid or tanh.  
Use Standardization when data has outliers or varies widely, better for models with ReLU or batch normalization.
